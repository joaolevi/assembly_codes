# Assembly codes
### Some codes in Assembly with representation in C


I created this repository to save assembly codes and help people who need to understand more about embedded systems.

At the beginning of the code you will find the names of the records:

    a - $s0
    b - $s1
    i - $t0
    j - $t1
    end[D] - $s2

below, the code in C:
```c
for(i = 0; i < a; i++)
   for(j = 0; j < b; j++)
	    D[4*j] = i + j;
```
And finally, the Assembly code...
